The code:
Use class toggling
Get rid of code duplication
Move themes into one file, so that theme change doesn't need to make a dedicated request
Add list persistence (so it at least doesn't get lost on page refresh)

The design:
Implement drag and drop (or another way of manipulating order)
Maybe make the input field activation area bigger
